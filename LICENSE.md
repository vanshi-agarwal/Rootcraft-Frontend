## 📋 Additional Terms

### Third-Party Assets

The Template includes third-party libraries and assets that are subject to their own licenses:

1. **Open Source Dependencies**: All included open-source libraries (React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, etc.) retain their original licenses (typically MIT). You must comply with their respective license terms.

2. **Demonstration Images**: Images from Unsplash are included for demonstration only and are subject to the [Unsplash License](https://unsplash.com/license). While these can be used freely, we recommend replacing them with your own licensed images for production.

3. **GSAP**: The GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) is included and subject to its Standard "no charge" license. For certain use cases (like SaaS or products for redistribution), you may need to obtain a commercial license from GreenSock.

See [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md) for a complete list of third-party assets and their licenses.
